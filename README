Assignment2:
    compile with `gcc -o /path/to/executable Assignment_2_Ilia_Denotkine.c -lpthread'
    execute with /path/to/executable

    usage: PROGNAME 
        -n number of floors [default 50]
        -p number of people [default 50]
        -m max capacity [default 2147483647]
        -t number of milliseconds per tick [default 1]
        -w maximum amount of time a worker will be working on his task (in ticks) [default 30]
        -v [prints 100-tick aggregation data]
        -vv [prints only who enters and leaves each tick]
        -vvv [prints ALL the events that occur per tick] [default]
        -h or --help [prints this message]

    notes: the LAST of the [-v,-vv,-vvv] commands is considered. so' -v -vvv -vv'  is interpreted as '-vv'
            -t specifies the amount of REAL time that happens between ticks.
            ONLY integers are accepted as parameters of the flags.
            each worker always works random amounts of time, between 1 tick and the amount of ticks specified by -w
            If there is nowhere to go, the elevator will not move.
            Passengers enter the elevator only when necessary
                ex: a passenger will NOT enter an elevator that carries passengers upwards if he (the passenger) needs to go downwards.

Sample output:
    /path/to/exec -n 25 -p 15 -m 5 -w 15 -vvv
    
    output (from the execution of this program for about 5 seconds):

    /path/to/exec -n 50 -p 100 -m 5 -w 50 -v

Assignment 1: implementing a shell.  
    Simply go into ass1, and compile with `gcc -o /path/to/executable Assignment_1_Ilia_Denotkine.c'
    then execute with /path/to/executable


    Warning: there is no prompt to

    Bonus features:
	parsing of variables
	    echo $PWD		prints the current directory
	    echo "$PWD"aaa	prints the current directory, appended with "aaa"
	history stores all the commands over all the sessions
