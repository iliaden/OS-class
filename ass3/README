Assignement # 3 - threads

everything has been implemented.

The minimal quantum size is 250 microseconds. if a lesser value is entered, it will be increased to 250 microseconds.
The cputime is displayed in microseconds

Threads that have been killed remain in RAM in order for it to be possible to display the amount of time each thread took to execute. 
(this can be fized with a single line - threads.c:35   comment out that line)

there is a harcoded limit for 100 semaphores. 
It can be modified in threads.c:9 


oh. and the makefile is hardcoded to compile with sem-ex.c
And you MUST use the mythreads.h file that I provide. It is different from the supplied one.
