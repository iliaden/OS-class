it works...

compile with 
gcc -g -Wall -o ./test sfs_api.c disk_emu.c sfs_test.c

the disk is stored in /tmp/my_disk  
it is a 4Mb disk.
block size = 1024
number of blocks = 4096
total disk size = 4Mb
Max number of files supported = 100
Max file size = not secified. as long as there is disk space.
Min file size = see above
Max filename length = 12 characters, including extension

The only attribute that is printed is the created time. 


test output: ( ./test )
